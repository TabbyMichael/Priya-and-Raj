# Indian Wedding Invitation Design Rationale

## Hierarchy Decisions

Our design prioritizes information based on guest needs:

1. **Hero Section** - Immediately establishes the couple's identity, wedding date, and purpose
2. **Events Section** - Core functionality with clear RSVP options for each event
3. **Venue Information** - Practical details for attendance
4. **Rituals Guide** - Cultural education for first-time attendees
5. **Dietary Information** - Guest comfort and inclusivity
6. **Livestream Access** - Remote participation option
7. **Gallery Section** - Post-event engagement

Each section uses visual hierarchy through typography, spacing, and color to guide the user naturally through the content.

## Cultural Sensitivity Approach

### Color Selection
- **Deep Maroon (#8B0000)**: Represents luxury and celebration without being overly stereotypical
- **Gold (#D4AF37)**: Symbolizes prosperity and elegance, used sparingly for accents
- **Peacock Blue (#008080)**: Reflects traditional Indian aesthetics without relying on bright turquoise
- **Ivory (#FEFDFC)**: Provides a sophisticated backdrop that doesn't compete with vibrant elements

These colors avoid clichéd combinations like bright pink/green while maintaining cultural authenticity.

### Typography
- **Playfair Display**: Elegant serif for headings that evokes traditional craftsmanship
- **Montserrat**: Clean sans-serif for body text ensuring accessibility
- Avoided overly decorative fonts that might be difficult to read or culturally appropriative

### Patterns and Motifs
Rather than using obvious patterns like paisley everywhere:
- Subtle geometric patterns inspired by traditional Indian architecture
- Minimalist mandala-inspired elements in section dividers
- Negative space utilization reminiscent of traditional Indian textile design

## Technical Implementation

### WordPress Structure
Created a custom theme from scratch to ensure originality:
- Single-page responsive design
- Custom post type for RSVP management
- AJAX-powered RSVP submission for seamless user experience
- Mobile-first approach ensuring accessibility across devices

### User Experience Features
1. **Per-Event RSVP**: Guests can selectively attend events rather than committing to the entire wedding
2. **Interactive Elements**: Modal forms for RSVP collection without page reloads
3. **Clear Visual Language**: Consistent iconography and color coding for different sections
4. **Performance Optimization**: Minimal dependencies and efficient code structure

## Accessibility Considerations

- Sufficient color contrast ratios
- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigable interface
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Clear focus states for interactive elements

## Unique Design Elements

1. **Accordion-Style Events**: Compact presentation that expands on interaction
2. **Ritual Cards**: Bite-sized educational content with symbolic icons
3. **Social Gallery Integration**: Hashtag system encouraging guest participation
4. **Dietary Transparency**: Clear communication about food offerings
5. **Livestream Inclusion**: Bridging physical and digital attendance

This approach ensures the invitation serves both practical and emotional needs while celebrating the cultural significance of the occasion without resorting to stereotypes.
